I am currently a Computer Science undergraduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta. I seek to design curious and creative machines that are empowered by effective and efficient algorithms to provide valued assistance in unstructured environments. I am affiliated to the [Healthcare Robotics Lab](http://pwp.gatech.edu/hrl/about/), Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines, Georgia Tech.
